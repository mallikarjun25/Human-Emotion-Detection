# Human-Emotion-Detection
This project proposes the development of a deep learning-based emotion recognition system using images. The system will employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images into one of seven emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral.

The dataset consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces, with each face centered and uniformly sized within the frame. The goal is to categorize each face into one of the seven emotion classes. The dataset contains 35,685 images, which are split into training and test sets for model building and evaluation. The images are initially stored as pixel values in CSV format. These pixel values are normalized to a range of [0,1] for efficient learning. The images are then reshaped into 2D arrays to match the input requirements of the CNN. To improve model generalization, data augmentation techniques such as rotation, horizontal flipping, and cropping are applied to the training set. The CNN is used for feature extraction, learning patterns in the facial expressions. A softmax activation function in the output layer will predict the probability distribution across the seven emotion categories, enabling accurate classification.
